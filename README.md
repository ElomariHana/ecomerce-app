We can practice Kafka by implementing features like:

Order Processing Pipeline – Publish order events to a Kafka topic and let different services (payment, inventory, shipping) consume them asynchronously.

Event-Driven Notifications – Send order confirmation, shipping updates, and other notifications through Kafka.

Real-Time Inventory Updates – Sync stock levels across services using Kafka topics.

User Activity Tracking – Log user actions like product views, searches, and clicks for analytics.

Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) – Handle failed messages by sending them to a separate Kafka topic for reprocessing.

Transaction Management – Implement idempotency and exactly-once processing using Kafka transactions.

Schema Management – Use Kafka Schema Registry to enforce structure on messages.

Streaming Data Processing – Use Kafka Streams or ksqlDB to process and transform data in real time.
